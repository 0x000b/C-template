# ğŸ§  C Template Alias

A simple alias that saves you from the boring task of including the header and writing the main()  every time.

## ğŸ”§ What It Does

- `vimc file.c`: Instantly creates a new C file with your favorite template and opens it in `vim`
- `nanoc file.c`: Same but opens in `nano`

## ğŸš€ Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0x000b/c-template.git
cd c-template
chmod +x install.sh fb.sh
./install.sh
